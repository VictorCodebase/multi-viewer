Hey guys👊🏽

feel free to contribute to multi-viewer.
This is a platform that allows multiple devices to stream media in one device simultaneously, saving storage issues

I'd have loved the code to be more modular but I made it in a rush out of need, just to get the basic part running. Feel free to make it more modular💖
